# MESHMOJI

This project explores 3D scan, real-time facial recognition, and mesh processing. Meshmoji provides users with a real-time customized emoji maker. It is based on mesh which is collected by 3D scanning users’ faces, then produces emoji by processing the mesh in real time, according users’ expression read by camera.

Emoji is popular in social network while 3D scanning seems far from our everyday life. We try to link these two terms so that 3D scanning becomes interesting and useful for people.
